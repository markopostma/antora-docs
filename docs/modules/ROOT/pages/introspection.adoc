= Introspection

The extension supports multiple ways of gathering schema information.

== Strategy

Currently `FILE`, `URL` and `INTROSPECTION` are supported introspection strategies. To determine the `strategy`, use the following scenarios:

1. **`FILE`** when a GraphQL schema is accessible locally. Expects a _relative_ path to one or more schema files. For example: `./relative-path-to/schema.graphql` or `./relative-path-to/*.graphql`.
2. **`URL`** when a GraphQL schema is accessible remotely via **HTTP** by POST or GET. Expects an _URL_ to an endpoint that serves a `.graphql` file. For example: `https://somehost.com/schema.graphql` or `https://somehost.com/schema`.
3. **`INTROSPECTION`** when a GraphQL endpoint is accessible remotely via **HTTP** by POST or GET. Expects an _URL_ to a GraphQL endpoint. For example: `https://somehost.com/graphql`.
